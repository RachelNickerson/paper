# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa. 
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).
Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which 
measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.
